# Crypto-Tracker 

Hello, as a lover of cryptocurrencies this is a simple tracker of them.
I wanted to practice my skill with **React** using some API and **Axios** for handle API requests.

You can download the folder, install node_modules and run the command npm start.

This is the link of my app if you want to have a look of it.
